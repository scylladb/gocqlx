// Package gocqlx is an idiomatic extension to gocql that provides usability
// features. With gocqlx you can bind the query parameters from maps and
// structs, use named query parameters (:identifier) and scan the query results
// into structs and slices. It comes with a fluent and flexible CQL query
// builder that supports full CQL spec, including BATCH statements and custom
// functions.
